# Web-Scrapping

This is a simple web scrapping project based on typing the random number in the search box and looping it with clicking the button using selenium. The extracted information from the website is stored in the text file. The information is extracted in the table format. In the file named `CdriverWhile.py` the information is directly extracted with in a suitable data format.

if you want to dip dive and want to scrap individual word and the words next to it then you can try with the file `OnlyTelephone`. There I have scrapped the text from the site and split it in a differnt word and separated with the need.Mainly I have scrapped phone numbers. Security is a fuckin lie these daysðŸ˜‚
